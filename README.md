I am a postdoc in the [Global Hydrology Lab](http://uncglobalhydrology.org/) working with Tamlin Pavelsky. My research interests lie within the interdisciplinary research fields of ecology and hydrology, which bridge the disciplinary perspectives in understanding the ecohydrological processes and bi-directional interactions and feedbacks at different spatiotemporal scales through integrating multi-source observations and model simulations. For my postdoc research, I will focus on understanding the links of inundation, vegetation, and carbon flux in boreal environments.
